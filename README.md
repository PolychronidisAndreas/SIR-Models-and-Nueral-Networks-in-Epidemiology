I've conducted a paper regarding the use of epidemiological models, such as SIR models, and neural networks for the study of an epidemic. There are several examples for this subjects about the 
COVID-19 virus and the effect it had (or could have had) to the total population of a small group. These results can be modified and used for larger groups of populations, given the right adjustments.
